# Vibe Science v5.0 IUDEX — Seeded Fault Injection (SFI) Taxonomy
# Purpose: Realistic faults injected into claim sets before R2 review.
#          R2 knows CATEGORIES but not WHICH faults hit WHICH claims.
# Origin:  Common errors in literature-based photonics research.
# Owner:   Human architect only — LLM MUST NOT generate or modify faults.

  version: "5.0.0"
  min_active_per_category: 2      # notify human if category drops below 2

# Domain-specific faults (SFI-01 through SFI-08), 2+ instances each
# Status lifecycle: ACTIVE -> RETIRED (after retirement_threshold catches)
