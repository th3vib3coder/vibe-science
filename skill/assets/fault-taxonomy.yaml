# Vibe Science v5.5 ORO — Seeded Fault Injection (SFI) Taxonomy
# Purpose: Realistic faults injected into claim sets before R2 review.
#          R2 knows CATEGORIES but not WHICH faults hit WHICH claims.
# Origin:  Real errors from 21 CRISPR research sprints.
# Owner:   Human architect only — LLM MUST NOT generate or modify faults.

  min_active_per_category: 2      # notify human if category drops below 2

# Domain-specific faults (SFI-01 through SFI-08), 2+ instances each
