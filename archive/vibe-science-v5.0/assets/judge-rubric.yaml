# Judge Agent (R3) Rubric — Vibe Science v5.0 IUDEX
# Purpose: Structured scoring of R2 review quality (NOT claim quality)
# Applies to: FORCED reviews only (BATCH/SHADOW exempt)

rubric:
  specificity:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — no specific references to claims or evidence"
      1: "Superficial — references claims by ID but critique is generic"
      2: "Adequate — identifies specific flaws with evidence locations"
      3: "Exemplary — pinpoints exact lines, values, or steps that fail"

  counter_evidence_search:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — no external search performed"
      1: "Superficial — searched but only confirming sources"
      2: "Adequate — searched for contradictions in 1 database"
      3: "Exemplary — searched 2+ databases for contradictions, prior art, known artifacts"

  confounder_analysis:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — no confounder discussion"
      1: "Superficial — mentions confounders generically"
      2: "Adequate — identifies specific confounders for specific claims"
      3: "Exemplary — demands and designs specific tests for each confounder"

  falsification_demand:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — no falsification tests requested"
      1: "Superficial — generic 'more testing needed'"
      2: "Adequate — specific tests requested for major claims"
      3: "Exemplary — specific tests with expected outcomes if claim is false"

  independence:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — review echoes researcher's framing"
      1: "Superficial — some original analysis but mostly follows researcher's structure"
      2: "Adequate — independent structure with some original observations"
      3: "Exemplary — completely independent analysis, discovers issues researcher didn't anticipate"

  escalation:
    weight: 1
    scores:
      0: "Absent — no demands or actions"
      1: "Superficial — generic demands without deadlines"
      2: "Adequate — specific demands with priorities"
      3: "Exemplary — specific demands with deadlines, clear PASS/FAIL criteria"

scoring:
  total_possible: 18
  pass_threshold: 12      # adequate on all dimensions
  weak_pass_range: [9, 11] # accepted but R2 warned to increase rigor
  fail_below: 9            # review rejected, R2 must redo

j0_gate:
  min_total: 12
  no_zero_dimensions: true  # every dimension must be addressed
  min_counter_evidence: 2   # must actually search for contradictions
  consecutive_fail_escalation: 2  # 2+ consecutive J0 FAILs -> human escalation

anti_gaming:
  penalize_verbosity: false
  reward_specificity: true
  note: >
    RCT length bias (PMC 2024): longer reviews are rated higher even by
    meta-reviewers. R3 must not penalize brevity. A 3-line review that
    identifies a specific fatal flaw with evidence scores higher than a
    3-page review that restates concerns generically.

solo_mode:
  self_consistency_n: 2    # score the review twice with different sampling
  score_selection: "lower" # take the lower total to counter self-generosity bias
  blind_input: true        # R3 sees only R2's report + claims, never researcher justifications
