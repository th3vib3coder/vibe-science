  Vibe Science v5.0 IUDEX is an AI-native research engine for Claude Code that
  transforms LLM agents into rigorous scientific investigators through structural
  enforcement, not just prompting. Grounded in Huang et al. (ICLR 2024), who
  proved that LLMs cannot self-correct reasoning without external feedback, v5.0
  introduces four architectural innovations that make adversarial review
  structurally unbypassable: Seeded Fault Injection (SFI), which injects known
  errors into claim sets before review to calibrate reviewer vigilance; Blind-First
  Pass (BFP), which forces the reviewer to assess claims without seeing the
  researcher's justifications, breaking anchoring bias; a Judge Agent (R3) that
  meta-reviews the quality of adversarial reviews on a 6-dimension rubric; and
  Schema-Validated Gates (SVG), where 8 of the system's 27 quality gates enforce
  JSON Schema validation against 9 read-only schema files, making prose claims of
  completion structurally impossible to accept. The core architecture is an
  OTAE-Tree (Observe-Think-Act-Evaluate) loop embedded in a branching tree search
  over hypotheses, with 7 node types, 3 tree modes, best-first selection, and
  automatic pruning. At the center of the system sits the Reviewer 2 Ensemble, a
  4-reviewer adversarial co-pilot operating in 6 modes (BRAINSTORM, FORCED, BATCH,
  SHADOW, VETO, REDIRECT) with a 12-flag mandatory checklist, double-pass review
  (Fatal Hunt then Method Repair), and mandatory counter-evidence search. Every
  quantitative claim must survive a Confounder Harness (raw estimate, conditioned
  estimate, propensity-matched estimate — sign change kills, collapse over 50
  percent downgrades, survival promotes). The system is governed by 10 Constitutional
  Laws that no agent, protocol, or user request can override, and enforced at
  runtime by Claude Code hooks that deterministically block premature closure,
  incomplete artifacts, and idle teammates. Additional subsystems include a
  Serendipity Engine with active radar scoring (0-20 scale, cross-branch pattern
  detection, escalation protocols), a Brainstorm Engine (Phase 0) with Inversion
  Exercise, Collision-Zone Thinking, and Productive Tensions, a 5-Stage Experiment
  Manager with iteration limits per stage, an Evidence Engine with typed claims and
  geometric confidence formula with hard veto thresholds, a Knowledge Base for
  cross-research-question persistence, and a Circuit Breaker that converts deadlocked
  review loops into DISPUTED claims (frozen, not killed) with a Stage 5 poison pill
  that blocks synthesis until disputes are resolved. An Agent Permission Model
  enforces separation of powers: Reviewer 2 produces verdict artifacts but never
  writes to the claim ledger; the Judge Agent scores reviews but never modifies
  them; schemas are read-only for all agents. The system supports both SOLO mode
  (all roles in one context window) and TEAM mode (Agent Teams with dedicated
  context windows per role). Developed and battle-tested over 21 sprints of
  CRISPR-Cas9 off-target research, where it caught four confounded claims that
  would have passed conventional AI review — including one with OR=2.30 and
  p < 10^-100 whose sign reversed under propensity matching.
