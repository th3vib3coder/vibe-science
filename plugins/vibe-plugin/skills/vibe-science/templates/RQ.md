# Research Question

## Question

[State the precise research question. Be specific enough that "yes/no" or a measurable answer is possible.]

## Hypothesis

[Testable hypothesis. Must be falsifiable.]

## Background

[2-3 paragraphs of context. What do we already know? What gap exists?]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1: Measurable outcome that would confirm hypothesis]
- [ ] [Criterion 2: Secondary validation]
- [ ] [Criterion 3: Data requirement met]

## Data Requirements

What data is needed to validate this hypothesis:

| Data Type | Source | Availability | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| [Type 1] | [Where] | [Yes/No/Unknown] | [ ] |
| [Type 2] | [Where] | [Yes/No/Unknown] | [ ] |

## Kill Conditions

Abandon this RQ if:

1. [Condition 1 - e.g., "No data exists after exhaustive search"]
2. [Condition 2 - e.g., "Hypothesis already disproven in literature"]
3. [Condition 3 - e.g., "Required computation infeasible"]
